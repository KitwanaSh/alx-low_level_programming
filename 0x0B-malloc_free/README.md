### Malloc and Free Project
This is a project tof the purpose of deeply understand dynamic memory allocationn.
At the end of this project, we expect to be able to:
- What is the difference between _automatic_ and _dynamic allocation_
- What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them
- Why and when use `malloc`
- How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak

We will develop soon about this.
